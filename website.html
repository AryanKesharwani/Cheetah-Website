        The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and
        central Iran. It is the fastest land animal, estimated to be capable of
        running at 80km/h to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph) with the fastest reliably
        recorded speeds being 93 and 98 km/h (58 and 61 mph), and as such has
        <br />several adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin
        legs and a long tail.

            The king cheetah is a variety of cheetah with a rare mutation for
            cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark,
            wide stripes extending from the neck to the tail. In Manicaland,
            Zimbabwe, it was known as nsuifisi and thought to be a cross between
            a leopard and a hyena. In 1926 Major A. Cooper wrote about a
            cheetah-like animal he had shot near modern-day Harare, with fur as
            thick as that of a snow leopard and spots that merged to form
            stripes. He suggested it could be a cross between a leopard and a
            cheetah. As more such individuals were observed it was seen that
            they had non-retractable claws like the cheetah. In 1927,
            Pocock described these individuals as a new species by the name of
            Acinonyx rex ("king cheetah"). However, in the absence of proof
            to support his claim, he withdrew his proposal in 1939. Abel Chapman
            considered it a colour morph of the normally spotted cheetah.
            Since 1927 the king cheetah has been reported five more times in the
            wild in Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern Transvaal; one was
            photographed in 1975. In 1981, two female cheetahs that had
            mated with a wild male from Transvaal at the De Wildt Cheetah and
            Wildlife Centre (South Africa) gave birth to one king cheetah each;
            subsequently, more king cheetahs were born at the centre. In
            2012, the cause of this coat pattern was found to be a mutation in
            the gene for transmembrane aminopeptidase (Taqpep), the same gene
            responsible for the striped "mackerel" versus blotchy "classic"
            pattern seen in tabby cats. The appearance is caused by
            reinforcement of a recessive allele; hence if two mating cheetahs
            are heterozygous carriers of the mutated allele, a quarter of their
            offspring can be expected to be king cheetahs.
